     The concept for Valorant began at Riot Games around 2014. Riot, known primarily for League of Legends, wanted to expand into the competitive shooter genre. The project was developed under the codename Project A before eventually being revealed to the public as Valorant. Joe Ziegler served as the game director, while David Nottingham was the creative director. Other key contributors included Trevor Romleski, a former League of Legends designer, and Salvatore Garozzo, a retired professional CS:GO player and map designer. The art direction was led by Moby Francke, who had previously worked on Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2.

From the start, Riot set clear goals for the game’s technical and competitive foundation. They wanted Valorant to be accessible on a wide range of hardware, so the game was built on a heavily modified version of Unreal Engine 4 to optimize performance, even on lower-end PCs. Riot also prioritized competitive integrity, implementing 128-tick servers, advanced anti-cheat technology, and network optimizations to minimize lag and ensure reliable hit registration.

     The first public teaser for the game appeared in October 2019, when Riot showcased Project A during its anniversary event. On March 1, 2020, the official title Valorant was revealed along with gameplay footage that drew immediate comparisons to Counter-Strike due to its tactical gunplay. Shortly after, the closed beta launched on April 7, 2020, available in select regions including North America and Europe. The beta generated enormous interest, with record-breaking Twitch viewership thanks to exclusive access drops.

The beta was later expanded to more regions, such as Brazil and South Korea, in May 2020. Following its successful testing period, Valorant had its global release on June 2, 2020. Riot emphasized at launch that this was just the beginning, promising frequent updates, new agents, and fresh maps to keep the game evolving.

      Even before release, Riot Games had plans to make Valorant a major esports title. In 2021, the company launched the Valorant Champions Tour (VCT), a global competitive circuit featuring regional Challengers, international Masters events, and the annual Champions tournament as its pinnacle. The game quickly established itself in the esports ecosystem, with top players and organizations from CS:GO, Overwatch, and other games transitioning into Valorant.

The competitive scene grew rapidly thanks to Riot’s structured support and the game’s strong spectator appeal. By blending fast-paced gameplay with strategic depth, Valorant became one of the most-watched esports titles worldwide within just a few years of its launch.
