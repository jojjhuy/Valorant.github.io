        <strong>Early Competitive Era</strong>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      When Valorant launched in 2020, Riot Games wasted no time in pushing it toward competitive play. The first big Riot-organized event was First Strike, a series of regional tournaments held later that year. This gave fans a taste of what professional Valorant could look like while allowing Riot to test formats and establish competitive integrity. Alongside First Strike, many third-party organizers ran their own competitions, which helped develop talent and gave professional teams early experience in the new title.

      In late 2020, Riot announced the Valorant Champions Tour (VCT), a global competitive circuit that officially launched in 2021. VCT became the backbone of Valorant esports, providing a structured and long-term pathway for teams worldwide. The format is built around three major competitive stages:
