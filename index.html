  <h1>About Valorant</h1>

  <p class="reading-text">
    Valorant is a first-person tactical shooter developed and published by Riot Games. 
    It takes a strong inspiration from the Counter-Strike series, borrowing several 
    mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving.
